        <h3>The Path of the plague</h3>
        <img src="http://www.vlib.us/medieval/graphics/bd-map.jpg">
        <p>In the begining of October in the year of the incarnation of the son of God 1347 acording to a contemparary is when the plague attacked Europe. It was said that the plage originated from China which to Europe was mysterious and legendary. Europe had a trade rought with china which is how the disease spread and it spread because of thousands of people moveing from place to place. In 1346 the disease passed on from China to a warrior horde a band of Kipchaks who were besieging a Genose trading port in Crimea. The leader of the horde saw they all were going to die in there horde so he ordered his men to catapult the infected corpses into the city, and the disease broke out emediatly. Then in a city called Messina the Genose were fleeing when they entered it. In Autum day they thought the plague had just appeared because in the middle ages they did not have many records about things happening in the past. Then at one point they found out it happened 2000 years erlier in the 3rd century B.C. the romans had recorded the presence of it in Africa. In A.D. 542 it appeared in Constantinople and over the next 50 years it passed over the whole of Europe. The desease always began at the sea cost and spread into the interior. The disease kept breaking out over the next 700 years. The plague then took hold of the hole continent of Europe. The disease spread almost from the Artic Circle to the Mediterraneam. In January 1348 ships put out for Messina and sailed up the coast of Italy. Then the disease attacked there ships so they abandoned the ship and spread the disease in the citys. By the end of the year Northern Italy, Corsica Sardinia, Spain, And france were infected with the disease. During 1349 it passed through the rest of Europe:Northern France, Hungary, Germany, and the Netherlands that all were over whealmed. In August 1348 a ship load of deasperate survivors put out for Calais hopeing to find refuge in the still plague free island of Britian. The ship docked at Melcombe Regis, Dorset, the passengers scrambled ashore and dispersed. By the end of the year it spread to all Southwest England. THe disease spread to East Anglia and Yorkshire by the summer of 1349 and by 1350 it had reached the extreme North and Ireland. Again terrified survivors took to the sea there ships bringing the plague to Scandinavia and the Baltic. From there the plague swept around to create the great circle of death. Occurred roughly around 1347 to 1356 the later ages called Black Death the worst plague ever in Europe but it was not the last, in that same century it happened 4 more times. Death roll went into the tens of thousands again. A brief out brake happened in Southern Italy after World War II and in 1966 the plague was reported in Vietnam. Then as medication got better scientists started looking for the true cause.         Note from the maker of wedsite: this might have been confuseing because it kept going back and forth in time well when i found this info it was wrought near to the way it is now. </p>

        <p>At one a'clock in the afternoon of March 20th, 1345, the planets Mars and Jupiter entered the sign of Aquarius and began to interact upon each other and the planet Earth. Jupiter,the warm,moist planet, drew up evil vapours: Mars, the hot, dry planet, set them alight. The heavens became disturbed as the constellations, by divine command, fought to aid the inhabitants of Earth. Flashes of brilliant light, the swooping passage of comets,balls of fire, fiery beams of wood- all these signified to the wise the advent of a vast calamity. In the Great Sea near India the waters boiled and heaved and a stinking mist arose which, drifting across the land, brought death with it. Reptiles and frogs were bred from the corruption and, in turn, spread contagion." That was one of the theries that some people thought. It was also believed that the series of violant earthquakes that disturbed southern Europe in the mid-14th century contributed to the plague. The foul vapours engendered by Jupiter were supposed to have built up inside the Earth and eventually forced their way out, creating earthquakes and adding there quota of poison to the atmosphere. The astrological theory was supposed to explain the remote cause of plague. Everyone agree that the immediate cause was the corruption of the air, but physicians differed as to how the corruption was actually brought about. Some held that it was produced by the huge </p>

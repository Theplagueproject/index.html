        <h3>The Path of the plague</h3>
        <img src="http://www.vlib.us/medieval/graphics/bd-map.jpg">
        <p>In the begining of October in the year of the incarnation of the son of God 1347 acording to a contemparary is when the plague attacked Europe. It was said that the plage originated from China which to Europe was mysterious and legendary. Europe had a trade rought with china which is how the disease spread and it spread because of thousands of people moveing from place to place. In 1346 the disease passed on from China to a warrior horde a band of Kipchaks who were besieging a Genose trading port in Crimea. The leader of the horde saw they all were going to die in there horde so he ordered his men to catapult the infected corpses into the city, and the disease broke out emediatly. Then in a city called Messina the Genose were fleeing when they entered it. In Autum day they thought the plague had just appeared because in the middle ages they did not have many records about things happening in the past. Then at one point they found out it happened 2000 years erlier in the 3rd century B.C. the romans had recorded the presence of it in Africa. In A.D. 542 it appeared in Constantinople and over the next 50 years it passed over the whole of Europe. The desease always began at the sea cost and spread into the interior. The disease kept breaking out over the next 700 years. The plague then took hold of the hole continent of Europe. The disease spread almost from the Artic Circle to the Mediterraneam. In January 1348 ships put out for Messina and sailed up the coast of Italy. Then the disease attacked there ships so they abandoned the ship and spread the disease in the citys. By the end of the year Northern Italy, Corsica Sardinia, Spain, And france were infected with the disease. During 1349 it passed through the rest of Europe:Northern France, Hungary, Germany, and the Netherlands that all were over whealmed. In August 1348 a ship load of deasperate survivors put out for Calais hopeing to find refuge in the still plague free island of Britian. The ship docked at Melcombe Regis, Dorset, the passengers scrambled ashore and dispersed. By the end of the year it spread to all Southwest England. THe disease spread to East Anglia and Yorkshire by the summer of 1349 and by 1350 it had reached the extreme North and Ireland. Again terrified survivors took to the sea there ships bringing the plague to Scandinavia and the Baltic. From there the plague swept around to create the great circle of death. Occurred roughly around 1347 to 1356 the later ages called Black Death the worst plague ever in Europe but it was not the last, in that same century it happened 4 more times. Death roll went into the tens of thousands again. A brief out brake happened in Southern Italy after World War II and in 1966 the plague was reported in Vietnam. Then as medication got better scientists started looking for the true cause.         Note from the maker of wedsite: this might have been confuseing because it kept going back and forth in time well when i found this info it was wrought near to the way it is now. </p>

      <h3>The Diagnosis</h3>
        <img src="http://static.wixstatic.com/media/1d92f6_f74354646874441290da791fadd3bf6b.jpeg/v1/fill/w_342,h_255,al_c,lg_1,q_80/1d92f6_f74354646874441290da791fadd3bf6b.jpeg">
        <p>At one a'clock in the afternoon of March 20th, 1345, the planets Mars and Jupiter entered the sign of Aquarius and began to interact upon each other and the planet Earth. Jupiter,the warm,moist planet, drew up evil vapours: Mars, the hot, dry planet, set them alight. The heavens became disturbed as the constellations, by divine command, fought to aid the inhabitants of Earth. Flashes of brilliant light, the swooping passage of comets,balls of fire, fiery beams of wood- all these signified to the wise the advent of a vast calamity. In the Great Sea near India the waters boiled and heaved and a stinking mist arose which, drifting across the land, brought death with it. Reptiles and frogs were bred from the corruption and, in turn, spread contagion." That was one of the theries that some people thought. It was also believed that the series of violant earthquakes that disturbed southern Europe in the mid-14th century contributed to the plague. The foul vapours engendered by Jupiter were supposed to have built up inside the Earth and eventually forced their way out, creating earthquakes and adding there quota of poison to the atmosphere. The astrological theory was supposed to explain the remote cause of plague. Everyone agree that the immediate cause was the corruption of the air, but physicians differed as to how the corruption was actually brought about. Some held that it was produced by the huge swarms of locusts that periodically descended upon Europe from the East. After stripping an area of its vegitation , the insects would die by the million and thererotting corpses were supposed to contribute to the " foul vapours" swirling over the Earth. The theory was a clear example of the confusion of the cause and effect. The Plague did frequently follow the locust invasions, but the link was not direct. The locust destroyed the crops, thereby creating widespread famine which , in turn, lowered the general resistance to the disease. Other physicians believed that the very elements of the air could not decay and so breed poison, or that the corruption was produced by change of seasons, by violant hot winds, or by the movements of animals. Curiously, many observers noticed the relationship between plague and rats which has now been proved to be part of the plague cycle. In the late 19th century it was established that the plague developed in the bodies of the fleas which, in thier turn, were parasites upon rats. As early ad the 10th century, however, the Arabian physician Avicenna actualy recorded that it was a sure sign of pestilence when rats came out of there holes and died in the open. If the rats had been examined it would have been seen that they were swarming with fleas, which passed to human hosts as soon as the rats were dead. But the warning passed unnoticed, buried among the scores of fantastic theories. Flea-bites were common human afflications, and there was no particular reason why people should suspect one class of flea rather than another. The term " Black Death" which we now use to describe this great epidemic came into use only in the 17th century. It describes the appearence of the body after death, when haemorrhages under ths skin gave the corpse a dark, mottled hue. In England, the term was probably adopted in order to make a distinction between earlyer plagues and the "Great Plague" which struck London in 1665. Even the word "plague" only came into use long after the great outbreak of the mid-14th century. Wycliffe, translating the Bible into English in 1382, used the word "plague" for a Latin word meaning blow or stroke. It was a vivid description of the terible speed with which the disease could act and it immediately passed into general use. The physicians in that time wrote down the two types of the plague, the first lasted two months, with constant fever and blood-spiting of this people died in 3 days. The second one lasted for the rest of the time. In this, together with constant fever, there were external carbuncles, or buboes, under the arm or in the groin, and the disease ran its course in five days. The contagion was great especially when there was blood-spitting, that even by looking at the sick it seemed people got it. The first pneumonic plague, was the more deadly, for it affected the respiratory system: "It is found that all who have died thus have had their lungs infected." The second, or bubonic, gave the victim some chance to recover. When people found that the docter was helpless they turned to the magician, who was swift to oblige-at a price. The migition made a way to supposebly keep the plague away and so did churches but they didn't work. Then other people tried to make remedies to also keep the plague away. Then another idea they tried was wringing the bells to get the disease out of the air like sturing a lake with a stick. Then there was a man named Clement VI, on the advice of a physician, he spent the entire plague period between two great fires- during the heat of the provencal summer. It was a high price to pay but it may have saved his life because the plague germ cannot live in extreme tempature.</p>

      <h3>The Dance of Death</h3>
        <img src="http://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/features/blackdeath_main.jpg">
        <p>physicians might examine corpses and astrologers plot the movements of planets to acount for the physical origins of the plague, but to the vast mass of people, there was only one true cause- the wrath of God. The plague was a divine punishment for sin. The fact was driven home in countless sermons: the wearing of pointed shoes, drinking, dancing, gambling, attending the theatre - all these, at one time or another, were cited as rousing God's especial anger.  </p>

        <h3>Interesting facts</h3>
        <img src="http://www.nuttyhistory.com/uploads/1/2/1/5/12150034/6814930_orig.jpg">
        <p>Plague doctors wore a mask with a bird-like beak to protect them from being infected by the disease, which they believed was airborne. In fact, they thought disease was spread by miasma, a noxious form of 'bad air. And the picture above is what they looked like. There also was a oil in the plague time that helped thieves rob people with the plague, the oil is currently called thieves oil it is made of natural erbs and plants and what it did was it was king of like a medician that prevented the plague some, so it is said. Also you can still get thieves oil today. Also the last interesting fact is the things the people learned from the plague has been helping cure Ebola a little.</p>
